Singleton Pattern:
 
- A class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.

There are two forms of singleton design pattern

Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.

Advantage of Singleton design pattern:
- Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.

Usage of Singleton design pattern
- Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications.
It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.

----------------------------

How to create Singleton design pattern?
- To create the singleton class, we need to have static member of class, private constructor and static factory method.

Static member: It gets memory only once because of static.
Private constructor: It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the class.
Static factory method: This provides the global point of access to the Singleton object and returns the instance to the caller.
