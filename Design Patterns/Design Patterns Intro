- Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers.

Advantage of design patterns:
- They are reusable in multiple projects.
- They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
- They capture the software engineering experiences.
- They provide transparency to the design of an application.
- They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built
  upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
- Design patterns don't guarantee an absolute solution to a problem.
  They provide clarity to the system architecture and
  the possibility of building a better system.
